		  <h4>Tribbler on Blockchain?</h4>
		  <p>
			  I had already made <a href="/site/tribbler.html" >Tribbler</a> based on a somewhat traditional approach to distributed systems: using a logical clock synchronized across all distributed data stores. This project aimed to explore the facets of blockchain through a re-implementation of Tribbler using blockchain.

			  <h4>How is Tribbler on blockchain different?</h4>
		  </header>
		  <p>
			  The main difference between the original Tribbler and the blockchain implementation is that the duties of data storage and synchronization is offloaded to the blockchain. I experimented with different proportions of computation between the frontend and backend to try and reduce <i>gas fees</i><br>
			  I found that we were able to offload a lot of the original Tribbler functionality to the frontend and thus minimized computation on the blockchain, reducing gas fees by 79.57% <br>
			  Moreover, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of blockchain and the behavior of dApps.
